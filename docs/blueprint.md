## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey trust and reliability, fitting for a healthcare platform. Dark color scheme is chosen, as it goes well with medical or formal services.
- Background color: Dark navy (#1A237E), providing a professional backdrop that reduces eye strain.
- Accent color: Turquoise (#00BCD4) to highlight interactive elements and key information, drawing the user's eye.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a sans-serif font for headlines. Its modern, geometric style will give a clear, up-to-date feel. Use 'PT Sans' for body text. Its humanist qualities combine modernism with warmth.
- Use flat, line-based icons to represent medical services, user roles, and actions, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with clear section divisions and a consistent design language across all dashboards. Prioritize important information and ensure easy navigation.
- Use subtle animations to enhance user interaction, such as smooth transitions between screens, feedback for button presses, and loading indicators to improve the overall experience.
